### BCS Bandits Presents: 
# The Last Laugh

<p> Welcome to Laugh Angeles. A world where a notorious comedian holds the last laugh. What remains is a desolate landscape of awkward silences and problematic statements. </p>

<p> You've taken it upon yourself to <i>BOO!</i> all the rats away. To do so, you will have to collect the tomato-ey sentiments of the despondent crowds and deliver them on stage to Ratt Rofe in a battle of comedic proportions.</p>

<p> Get ready to jump, sling and splat. :tomato:</p>

<p> Good luck! The cityâ€™s happiness depends on your confidence.</p>

### How to Play:
* WASD to move
* Space to interact and jump
* Mouse to aim
